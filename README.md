## Disclaimer
* The program just uses for fun will not engage in any commercial purpose and offensive way. 
* Do not use any music whose score has copyright.
***
## Known Issues
* The game prop has a limited range of only three octaves, so some tones can't be produced.
* The real music plays faster and slower depending on the chapter, and the program can only simulate resting notes between keystrokes. It can only be used to a certain extent to change the tempo or speed of playing.
